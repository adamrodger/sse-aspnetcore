Server Sent Events in ASP.Net Core Example
==========================================

This example shows how to use Server Sent Events (SSE) with ASP.Net Core to push events from
the server back to a browser asynchronously.

Start the service with:

```bash
cd src/SSE.AspNetCore
dotnet run
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` from a browser to see the SSEs being received and
actioned.
